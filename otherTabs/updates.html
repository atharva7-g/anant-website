                    <p>March 2020: Nishant Gupta represented the team at the IEEE Aerospace conference 2020 held at
                        Yellowstone,
                        Montana, USA. Nishant is the telemetry subsystem lead and author of two out of three papers
                        presented at the
                        conference.
                        The first paper describes the design procedure of an onboard and ground station telemetry
                        architecture for a
                        Cubesat. The second paper is primarily authored by Avishek Prasad, and details the interface
                        architecture
                        between the Telemetry and OBC subsystems. Lastly, Nishant presented a paper on behalf of other
                        team members
                        from ADCS. This paper investigates the instabilities in detumbling algorithms, which are used to
                        lower the
                        angular velocity of a satellite.<br>
